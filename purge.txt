Purge by dc

This is a derivative of the original map Purge for Cube 2 made by JoJo. This map is ported to Tesseract with some modifications to geometry and texturing.
There have also been small modifications to accomodate the physics of Red Eclipse 2, with different clipping and obstacle placement.
